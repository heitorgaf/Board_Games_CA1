# Board_Games_CA1

The dataset contains information about board game names, publication years, average user ratings, user counts, game genres, mechanics, and much more. This data makes it possible to analyze trends, patterns, and the popularity of various board games thoroughly. In order to add the visual appeal of games while maintaining the necessary level of business seriousness, a relationship between colors and typography will be constructed as part of a project that intends to visually examine this dataset.
